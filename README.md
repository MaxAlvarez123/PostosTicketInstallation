- Help Topics will determine what Department the ticket is routed to which will determine which Agents have access to the ticket. The Help Topic also can determine other configurations of the ticket, such as the ticketâ€™s SLA (or Service Level Agreement) and priority of a ticket, i.e. Emergency to Low.

- To create a Help Topic go to Admin Panel -> Mange -> Help Topic -> Add New Help Topic

- And those are all of the basic feature to get ur ticketing system up and running.
